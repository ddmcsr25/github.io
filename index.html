  <h1>Android FRP Bypass Vulnerability on Pixel 6</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Derek Morris<br>
  <strong>Reported to:</strong> Google Android Security Rewards Program<br>
  <strong>Date Reported:</strong> June 2024<br>
  <strong>Status:</strong> Won’t Fix (Intended Behavior)<br>
  <strong>Reward:</strong> Issued<br>
  <strong>Build Fingerprint:</strong> <code>google/oriole/oriole:14/AP2A.240605.024/11860263:user/release-keys</code></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This report documents a critical security flaw on a Google Pixel 6 running Android 14. The flaw allows a user to bypass Factory Reset Protection (FRP) — even with a locked bootloader and USB debugging disabled — by sideloading a beta OTA update via recovery mode.
      The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed and rewarded by Google, but marked as “Won’t Fix (Intended Behavior).”
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Exploit Impact</h2>
    <p>
      With physical access to a locked device, an attacker can:
      <ul>
        <li>Bypass FRP and user PIN security</li>
        <li>Re-enroll the device under a new Google account</li>
        <li>Access developer options and unlock the bootloader</li>
        <li>Install custom or factory ROMs</li>
        <li>Use or resell the device without authorization</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Reproduction Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Tested on Pixel 6 (Android 14, June 2024 security patch). Required tools:
      <ul>
        <li>Android Platform Tools (ADB)</li>
        <li>Pixel Flasher Tool</li>
        <li>Android 15 Beta 3.1 OTA image</li>
      </ul>
      Full steps:
      <ol>
        <li>Boot into recovery and factory reset the device.</li>
        <li>Complete setup with a Google account and PIN; confirm FRP is active.</li>
        <li>Reboot into recovery mode → Select “Apply update from ADB.”</li>
        <li>Connect to PC via USB → Use Pixel Flasher to sideload Android 15 beta image.</li>
        <li>Once flashed, reboot the device → Setup no longer enforces previous account or lock.</li>
        <li>Developer options and OEM unlocking now accessible.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Root Cause</h2>
    <p>
      Android’s ADB sideload implementation does not properly enforce FRP state post-flash. The process resets the security state without re-verifying the account or PIN lock after flashing an OTA image.
    </p>
