    <h1>Pixel 6 FRP Security Research — Public Attribution</h1>

    <p class="meta">
      <strong>Researcher:</strong> Derek Morris (ddmcsr25)<br>
      <strong>Published:</strong> July 2024<br>
      <strong>Focus:</strong> Factory Reset Protection (FRP) / device protection behavior and security impact analysis
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Important:</strong> This page is a <em>non-operational</em> security write-up for attribution and defensive awareness.
      It does <strong>not</strong> include bypass instructions, step-by-step reproduction, tooling guidance, or exploit code.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I reported security research findings affecting Google Pixel 6 (Android 14) to Google through the Android &amp; Devices
      Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP/ASR). Google acknowledged the report and issued a reward. This page exists to provide
      a stable public reference that I was the submitting researcher.
    </p>

    <h2>Public Reference</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Issue Tracker ID:</strong> <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/352333773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">352333773</a></li>
      <li><strong>Submitted by:</strong> Derek Morris</li>
      <li><strong>Acknowledged:</strong> Yes</li>
      <li><strong>Reward Issued:</strong> Yes</li>
      <li><strong>Status:</strong> Marked as intended behavior / won’t fix (per Google’s triage)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security Impact (High-Level)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Concerns the real-world risk when a device is in an ownership-verification/FRP context.</li>
      <li>Highlights what an attacker with <strong>physical access</strong> could attempt under certain conditions.</li>
      <li>Evaluates the behavior against a practical threat model and user-protection expectations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why “Intended Behavior” Can Still Matter</h2>
    <p>
      Some reports are classified as “intended behavior” because they fall within an accepted threat model or require
      conditions (e.g., physical access) that the platform treats differently from remote exploitation. Even so, documenting
      the risk helps users and defenders understand protections and residual gaps.
    </p>

    <h2>Defensive Guidance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep devices updated to the latest stable Android security patch level.</li>
      <li>Use a strong device passcode and account security (2FA where possible).</li>
      <li>For enterprises: consider MDM/enterprise device policies and inventory controls for devices at risk of loss/theft.</li>
      <li>If you bought a used device: complete official ownership transfer steps and obtain proof of purchase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disclosure Timeline</h2>
